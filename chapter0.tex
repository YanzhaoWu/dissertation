\begin{abstract}

The advance of new I/O technologies has tremendously improved I/O performance.
This raises a question on how the new I/O technologies benefit
large-scale data analysis. This dissertation addresses this question by
developing a data analysis ecosystem called FlashX to target a large range of
data analysis tasks. FlashX includes three subsystems: SAFS, FlashGraph and
FlashMatrix. SAFS is a user-space filesystem optimized for a large SSD array
to deliver maximal I/O throughput from SSDs. FlashGraph
is a general-purpose graph analysis framework that processes graphs in
a semi-external memory fashion and scales to graphs with billions of vertices
by utilizing SSDs through SAFS in non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA).
FlashMatrix is a matrix-oriented programming framework for general data analysis
with a high-level functional programming interface. Similar to FlashGraph, it
scales matrix operations beyond memory capacity by utilizing SSDs. We demonstrate
that with the current I/O technologies FlashGraph and FlashMatrix in
the (semi-)external-memory mode are capable of achieving performance comparable
to their in-memory mode while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
in-memory counterparts for a large variety of data analysis tasks.
