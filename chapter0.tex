\begin{abstract}

The advance of new I/O technologies has tremendously improved random I/O
performance. It raises the question how the new I/O technologies benefit
large-scale data analysis. This dissertation addresses this question by
developing two frameworks to target large-scale graph analysis and machine
learning.
FlashGraph
is a general-purpose graph analysis framework that processes graphs in
a semi-external memory model and scales to graphs with billions of vertices
by utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) in non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA).
FlashMatrix is a matrix-oriented programming framework for general data analysis
with high-level functional programming interface. Similar to FlashGraph, it
scales matrix operations beyond memory capacity by utilizing SSDs. We demonstrate
that with the current I/O technologies FlashGraph and FlashMatrix in
the (semi-)external-memory mode are capable of achieving performance comparable
to their in-memory mode while significantly outperforming state-of-art in-memory
counterparts.
