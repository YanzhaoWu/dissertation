\begin{abstract}

With the explosion of data volume and the increasing complexity of data analysis,
large-scale data analysis imposes significant challenges in systems design.
While the current research focuses on scaling out
to a large clusters, these scale-out solutions introduce significant overheads.
This thesis is motivated by the advance of new I/O technologies such as flash
memory. Instead of scaling out, we explore efficient system designs in a single
commodity machine with non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) and scale to large
datasets by utilizing commodity solid-state drives (SSDs). This thesis explores
the impact of the new I/O technologies in large-scale data analysis.
Instead of implementing individual data analysis algorithms for SSDs, we
develop a data analysis ecosystem called FlashX to target a large range of
data analysis tasks. FlashX includes three subsystems: SAFS, FlashGraph and
FlashMatrix. SAFS is a user-space filesystem optimized for a large SSD array
to deliver maximal I/O throughput from SSDs. FlashGraph is a general-purpose
graph analysis framework that processes graphs in a semi-external memory fashion
and scales to graphs with billions of vertices by utilizing SSDs through SAFS.
FlashMatrix is a matrix-oriented programming framework that supports both sparse
matrices and dense matrices for general data analysis. Similar to FlashGraph, it
scales matrix operations beyond memory capacity by utilizing SSDs. We demonstrate
that with the current I/O technologies FlashGraph and FlashMatrix in
the (semi-)external-memory meets or even exceeds state-of-the-art in-memory
data analysis frameworks while scaling to massive datasets for a large variety
of data analysis tasks.
