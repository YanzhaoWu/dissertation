FlashMatrix is a matrix-oriented programming framework for general data analysis
with high-level functional programming interface. It scales matrix operations
beyond memory capacity by utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) in non-uniform
memory architecture (NUMA). It provides a small number of generalized matrix
operations (GenOps) and reimplements a large number of matrix operations in
the R framework with GenOps. As such, it executes R code in parallel and out of
core automatically. FlashMatrix
uses vectorized user-defined functions (VUDF) to reduce the overhead of function
calls and fuses matrix operations to reduce data movement between CPU and
SSDs. We implement multiple machine learning algorithms in R to benchmark
the performance of FlashMatrix. On a large parallel machine, out-of-core
execution of these R implementations in FlashMatrix has performance comparable
to in-memory execution on a billion-scale dataset while significantly
outperforming the in-memory implementations of Spark MLlib.
